react softuni exam project march 2025

## Overview: 
This app is a forum similar to reddit and 4chan with a simplistic view...

<---------------------------------------------------->

## Brief history
the name "ForumX" came from my inabillity to name the application
and so I thought to use "X" as in maths it is an undefined variable

<---------------------------------------------------->

## Future ideas
I've always wanted to make a forum and now that an opportunity arose
I'm motivated to continue development even after this react course
because coding is my passion

<---------------------------------------------------->
